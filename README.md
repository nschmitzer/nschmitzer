Nick Schmitzer Personal Project
==========

<h5>PURPOSE:</h5>

This repository serves as a place to store Nick Schmitzer's Personal Project for Professor Clark's CIS 440 (1:30pm) class.

<h5>PROJECT DETAILS:</h5>
For my personal project I created a personal one page website for myself. The purpose of this website is to help promote myself in the professional workplace. This website serves as an digital resume for me and can be used at career fairs and when looking for employment opportunities. On this website I wrote about what I have been involved in during college, what my current career goals are, and what my future career goals are. Furthermore this website also has two links to my professional resume and two links to my LinkedIn profile.

For this project I started with a CSS template that I found online for a website that any new company could use. From this template I then changed the CSS, JS, and HTML to transform the website into my own. The reason that I used a CSS template is because much like with open-source projects on GitHub, a programmer should not have to re-write code if it is already available. 

When creating my website I had to edit the JS for the slider on the page. I decided that I didn't want a slider, but I liked the way that the individual slide looked, so I kept the appearance while changing the JS. Furthermore with the HTML I had to add/remove divs, hrefs, tags, and edit the content. For the CSS I had to create several new classes and edit the styling of several of the pre-existing classes.

<h5>SKILLS DEVELOPED:</h5>
During this project I was able to further develop my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. I enjoyed having the opportunity to develop these skills because for the Group Project I have been mainly working on backend development. Also I was able to develop my skill of understanding of pre-written code to make necessary modifications. The ability/skill to understand and then edit someone elseâ€™s code is huge considering more coding is being done in team environments.

<h5>FUTURE PLANS:</h5>
I plan on purchasing a domain and hosting for this website, so that I will finally have a personal professional website for myself. I plan on putting the url to this website on my business cards so that when I hand them out people can them go online to read more about me and download my resume. I plan on continuing to develop/maintain this site as my career continues to grow.
